# java-ddd
Java port of a C# DDD micro-framework.

This port of my existing C# code found at https://bitbucket.org/RowanWillis/domain-driven-design was developed in order to learn Java by translating some existing code.

The library itself is inteded to demonstrate how the constraints required for Value Types, Entities and Aggregate roots can be implemented without restricting further implementation of any domain logic.
